This project contains scripts used to perform the following workflow:
  1. Process Bulk RNA Seq NCBI samples given by SRR number
  2. Quantify abundances of genes of interest and generate a count matrix
  3. Normalize and scale the count matrix
  4. Extract orthologous genes between samples for downstream comparative analysis
  5. Perform differential expression analysis between groupings
  6. Generate figures such as heatmaps volcano plots
